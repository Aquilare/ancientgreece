# Ancient Greece
## Archaic Greece
Until the 8th century BC, Greece had experienced its own dark ages. These dark ages had come about due to the collapse of the Mycenaean Civilization some 3-400 years prior. Because of these Dark Ages, there was a loss of literacy, and a loss of the Mycenaean writing system. The Greeks therefore adopted the Phoenician alphabet and created from it the Greek alphabet. Greece at this time was composed of various autonomous communities, the borders of which were defined by their geography, for example, by being divided either by the sea or surrounding mountain ranges.

The earliest recorded war in Ancient Greece was the 60 year long Lelantine war (710-650 BC), which was fought between the city-states (*poleis*) of Eretria and Chalcis over the fertile land of the island of Evia known as the Lelantine plains. Despite Chalcis being named the victor of the war, both poleis appear to have suffered decline as a result of the conflict.

A merchant class had arisen in Greece after the introduction of coined currency in the 7th century BC. Many Greek city states had seen an increase in political tension as a result, as the local aristocrats had feared the political ambitions of the wealthy. Populist rhetoric coming from the politically ambitious had become common in the Greek city-states, which the aristocracy had to defend their own power against. Another source of political and class-based tension at this time was an increasing population coupled with a shortage of land. 

In Sparta, the military conquest of Messenia (a region of the Peloponnese peninsula) resulted in the subjugation of the Messenians in the later part of the 8th century BC. From this ensued a dramatic change in social structure in Sparta, with the emergence of a class of farmers and laborers being known as *helots*, and a warrior class composed of every male citizen of Sparta, having been permanently enlisted. Military service was required of men rich and poor alike, thus limiting socio-economic tension between the two. These developments are attrtibuted to the reforms of Lycurgus, which are understood to have been completely implemented by 650 BC.

In the later part of the 7th century BC, Athens had experienced a crisis related to land and farming, thus resulting once again in civil tensions. In response, Draco, the *Archon* or chief magistrate of Athens had severely altered the Athenian law code in 621 BC, in a failed attempt to solve the strife. This is where our word *draconian* comes from. Eventually the legislator Solon had reformed the Athenian law code to be more moderate. This served to somewhat stabilize Athens and ease the burdens of the poor, but had also served to solidify the status of the Athenian aristocracy. 

By the next century, many of the region's city states had gained prominence in the area, such as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes. All of these city states had by this point expanded their territories outward, absorbing local towns and rural lands. Athens and Corinth, had also by this time come to be a major force in both trade and over the seas.
