# Ancient Greece
## The Pre-Classical Era 
Until the 8th century BC, Greece had experienced its own dark ages. These dark ages had come about due to the collapse of the Mycenaean Civilization some 3-400 years prior. Because of these Dark Ages, there was a loss of literacy, and a loss of the Mycenaean writing system. The Greeks therefore adopted the Phoenician alphabet and created from it the Greek alphabet. Greece at this time was composed of various autonomous communities, the borders of which were defined by their geography, for example, by being divided either by the sea or surrounding mountain ranges.

The earliest recorded war in Ancient Greece was the 60 year long Lelantine war (710-650 BC), which was fought between the city-states (*poleis*) of Eretria and Chalcis over the fertile land of the island of Evia known as the Lelantine plains. Despite Chalcis being named the victor of the war, both poleis appear to have suffered decline as a result of the conflict.

In Sparta, the military conquest of Messenia (a region of the Peloponnese peninsula) resulted in the subjugation of the Messenians in the later part of the 8th century BC. From this ensued a dramatic change in social structure in Sparta, with the emergence of a class of farmers and laborers being known as *helots*, and a warrior class composed of every male citizen of Sparta, having been permanently enlisted. Military service was required of men rich and poor alike, thus limiting socio-economic tension between the two. These developments are attrtibuted to the reforms of Lycurgus, which are understood to have been completely implemented by 650 BC.

A merchant class had arisen in Greece after the introduction of coined currency in the 7th century BC. Many Greek city states had seen an increase in political tension as a result, as the local aristocrats had feared the political ambitions of the wealthy. Populist rhetoric coming from the politically ambitious had become common in the Greek city-states, which the aristocracy had to defend their own power against. Another source of political and class-based tension at this time was an increasing population coupled with a shortage of land. 

In the later part of the 7th century BC, Athens had experienced a crisis related to land and farming, thus resulting once again in civil tensions. In response, Draco, the *Archon* or chief magistrate of Athens had severely altered the Athenian law code in 621 BC, in a failed attempt to solve the strife. This is where our word *draconian* comes from. Eventually the legislator Solon had reformed the Athenian law code to be more moderate. This served to somewhat stabilize Athens and ease the burdens of the poor, but had also served to solidify the status of the Athenian aristocracy. 

By the next century, many of the region's city states had gained prominence in the area, such as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes. All of these city states had by this point expanded their territories outward, absorbing local towns and rural lands. Athens and Corinth, had also by this time come to be major forces in both trade and over the seas. 

As a result of the quickly growing Greek populations, many Greeks had fled the mainland, creating new settlements in Southern Italy and Sicily (*Magna Graecia*) as well as in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey) and thus expanded Greek influence well beyond the area of Greece as we know it today. While we understand these settlements to be "colonies", they were not connected to mainland Greece--as Early Modern European colonies were to their mother countries--but rather were merely only connected to mainland Greece via their shared religious practices and trade.

After the colonization of Sicily by Greek emigrants, conflicts with the Carthaginians of Northern Africa (especially in the city of Syracuse) soon erupted. These conflicts lasted several centuries, until the Roman Republic and its ally in the Italian mercenaries known as the *Mammertines* defended themselves against both the then tyrant of Syracuse, Hiero II, and the Carthaginians in 265 BC. From the end of these conflicts, the Roman republic had emerged as the dominant force of the region, as the prominence of Carthage and the Greek city-states in Sicily had declined. A year afterwards the first Punic War had erupted between Rome and Carthage. 

Between the years of 800 and 300 BC, Greece at large (including its colonies) had experienced tremendous levels of economic growth, with estimates concluding that the average household size quintupled in this period, indicating a dramatic increase in average household wealth.  

In the latter half of the 6th century BC, Athens had experienced the triple tyranny of Peisistratos and his sons Hippias and Hipparch. In the year 510 BC, the Athenian aristocrat Cleisthenes had convinced the Spartan king Cleomenes I to assist the Athenians in over throwing the the tyranny. After the overthrow, conflict broke out between Athens and Sparta with Sparta installing Isagoras as the archon. In an effort to retain independence from  Sparta, Cleisthenes instigated a democratic revolution, deposing Isagoras and resisting Spartan efforts to reinstall him as archon. From this point Athens had defended its newly founded democracy: a visionary form of government whereby all citizens shared power with one another regardless of social status. With democracy now being the Athenian way, many of the problems it had faced had been subsequently solved, and had paved the way for Athens to have its own Golden Age.
